# ImageSwitcher
App created in Android Studio 2.1.2 and tested on a Nexus 5 Android Emulator then on a Motorola Moto X Developer Edition Android phone.

This app demonstrats a simple Image Switcher using two buttons: 'PREV' for previous image and 'NEXT' for next image.

The app launches and has a simple screen showing two buttons and a title in the middle "Zoo Critters".

When the user clicks the 'NEXT' button the slide show of images starts and goes forward but it can also 
go back to the previous image by clicking the 'PREV' button.
